# Interpret Segmentation
A one-stop shop for the interpretability of image segmentation models.
This code was extracted from my bachelors thesis: https://github.com/andef4/thesis-code

Modified algorithms for use in image segmentation:
* RISE
* Grad-CAM

New algorithm developed specifically for the interpretability of image segmentations:
* Hausdorff Distance Masks
